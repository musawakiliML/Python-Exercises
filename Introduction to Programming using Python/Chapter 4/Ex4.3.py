*4.3 (Algebra: Solve 2 x 2 Linear Eqautions) You can use the Cramer's to solve the following 2 x 2 system of linear equation:
        
        ax + by = e      x = (ed - bf) / (ad - bc)
        cx + dy = f      y = (af - ec) / (ad - bc)
        
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a,b,c,d,e, and f and display the result. 
If ad - bc = 0,report that The Equation has no solution.
