# Python Programming Exercises and Solutions
## This Repo contains complete Solutions to exercises in the following books:
### Introduction To Programming Using Python [link]()
### Starting Out With Python [link]()

All the exercises in both books will be solved in this repo as single python files and a jupyter notebook of all the exercises with a test run.
This will help you compare your solutions to see if your code runs as expected.
